* explain/oxygen
  - Oxygen is a colorless, odorless gas that makes up about one fifth of the atmosphere.  It is used by living things to create energy from food.  You need oxygen to live.

* explain/concentrator
  - An oxygen concentrator is a device that uses a device known as a "sieve bed" that has different affinity for oxygen at different pressures, along with a pump to pressurize it, to collect oxygen from the atmosphere and concentrate it to deliver more oxygen than is present in the atmosphere.  It allows patients to have supplemental oxygen without requiring prefilled oxygen tanks.

* explain/tank
  - An oxygen tank is simply a container for oxygen.  The oxygen is stored under pressure, so a small tank can contain a large amount of oxygen.  A regulator allows the oxygen to be extracted from the tank at a lower, controlled pressure.

* explain/why
  - Some conditions reduce a person's ability to use oxygen from the air, causing their bodies to have to work harder and accomplish less.  Supplemental oxygen allows them to have improved health, activity levels, and alertness.  The oxygen can come from tanks or a concentrator, then tubing routes it to you, where a cannula in your nose allows you to breathe normally and get your supplemental oxygen without having to do or learn anything special.
